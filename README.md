# huffman-project

Huffman Encoding and Decoding algoritms using Java's stack

Compresses text files and then decompresses them back to their original state.

HuffmanEncode expects 2 command line arguments: the name of the source file (the file to be compressed) and the name
of the destination file (the file to which the compressed file must be written)

HuffmanDecode expects 2 command line arguments: the name of the source file (a file that contains a compressed file
created by your encoder) and the name of the destination file (the file to which the uncompressed file must be written)
